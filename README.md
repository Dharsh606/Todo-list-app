## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or higher
- `requests` library for auto-update functionality

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
   cd <your-repo>
Auto-Update System
The app periodically checks an online version file to determine if an update is available.

If a newer version exists, it downloads the updated executable.

Note: Due to Windows restrictions on overwriting running executables, a separate updater helper script is recommended to complete the update process.

You need to host the version file (e.g., version.txt) and updated executable on a web server or GitHub releases with direct links.

Usage

Add tasks with optional due dates.

View and manage your current tasks in a clean, simple interface.

Receive reminders based on due dates.

Keep your app updated easily with the auto-update feature.
